# Movie-Finder

## Description
    We devoloped a website that will allow you to easily find which streaming service a movie is on. Using HTML, CSS, Bulma, JS and Jquery our group created a simple yet very functional user interface. By first searching through an imbd fetch request to find the correct movie you will be shown a list of relevant searches to choose from. Once the user finds their movie then they can select it and will prompt them with links to the websites or an error message. The user can then search for a new movie or select a button.

## Installation

To install this project go to https://github.com/israelmrios/Movie-Finder and copy the SSH key to clone it to your terminal.

Go to https://israelmrios.github.io/Movie-Finder/ and search any movie you want with the input region. Next, find the specificy movie you were looking for and click the button below it. If it is available on any of the top 6 streaming platforms a button will be displayed with a link to the movie.
